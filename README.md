Welcome!

This small utility is designed to be used with Razbams F-15E for DCS World. 

It allows you to generate the Loaded weight, Drag Index, Lateral Assyemtery of a loadout, and Takeoff Performance calculations. 

Fuel planning, etc, will come later. 

Please let me know if you have any issues here or via Discord.
